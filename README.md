# Hotel Booking Cancellations Predictive Analytics


This project addresses the growing challenge of hotel booking cancellations‚Äîa major concern for revenue management in the hospitality industry. Our objective was to identify the key drivers of cancellations and develop a predictive model to help hotels proactively manage bookings and improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

We analyzed over 119,000 hotel booking records to:
- Identify trends and patterns related to cancellations
- Build a machine learning model to predict high-risk bookings

- You can access the dataset [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hotel-bookings-analysis).
